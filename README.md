QuestionResolver
================

A (simple) QA-System exploiting Wikipedia infoboxes. These are stubs not containing any legally relevant data that I wrote in the intial phase of a project for a search company.

Unfortunately, the repository lacks required data due to copyright reasons.

Also, it uses a MongoDB-database and a few .NET packages that need to be installed manually (or through Visual Studio).
